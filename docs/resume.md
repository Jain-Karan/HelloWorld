 Graduated with CGPA 8.66 in July 2018  
> - Coursework includes Algorithm Design and Analysis, Data Mining and Warehousing, Computer Networks, Embedded Systems, Compiler Design and Theory of Computation, Web Programming, Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, Software Design, Mobile Computing,Courses on OOPS approach in Python/C/C++  

> ## Projects and Research
> - Home Automation with Python,Arduino and Bluetooth  
An Arduino based system that interacts with appliances using Bluetooth. Also uses OpenCV for image-processing to detect a person. Triggers on/off via PySerial to Arduino.Added Twilio for SMS alerts
> - Stock Market Prediction using Back-propagation Algorithm and Machine Learning  
A Python program that simulates the Back-propagation Algorithm on stock data. This is used to predict future behavior and fluctuations. Graphical representations are plotted using matplotlib. Revised solution with Machine Learning (RNN and LSTM)
> - Pedestrian Detection and Surveillance    
A fuzzy approach to detecting pedestrian. Involves applying type-2 fuzzy logic on preprocessed (background subtracted) silhouettes to determine attributes via silhouettes'  properties and accordingly classify.
